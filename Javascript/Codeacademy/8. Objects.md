# Object

In JS we create objects with object literals `{}` , and we can assign it to a variable. (Alternatively we can use the Object() constructor like `const obj = new Object()` which creates an empty object, but we don't need to use that now.)

We make a key-value pair by writing the keyâ€™s name, or *identifier*, followed by a colon and then the value. We separate each key-value pair in an object literal with a comma (`,`). Keys are strings, but when we have a key that does not have any special characters in it, JavaScript allows us to omit the quotation marks:

```javascript
// An object literal with two key-value pairs
let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',
  color: 'silver'
};
```

You access *properties* of an object using the dot notation:

```javascript
let theColor = spaceship.color
console.log(theColor)	//silver
```

But if the key needs to be enclosed in "", ie. it contains numbers, symbols, empty spaces, we need the [ ] notation:

```javascript
let fuel = spaceship["Fuel Type"]
console.log(fuel)	//diesel
```

We also need [ ] notation if a variable holds the property name. Because with the dot notation, JS will search for the variable name in the keys of the object

```javascript
let question = "Fuel Type"
console.log(spaceship[question])	//diesel
```



Objects are mutable, meaning we can change its properties

One of two things can happen with property assignment:

- If the property already exists on the object, whatever value it held before will be replaced with the newly assigned value.
- If there was no property with that name, a new property will be added to the object.

Note that even if the object is assigned to a variable `const`, we can still mutate the internal fields of the object.

We can delete key-value pairs using keyword `delete`.

```javascript
spaceship.color = "red"
delete spaceship["Fuel Type"]
```



We create object methods in a similar way.

There are 2 slight different syntax for it. First, method name : anonymous function

```javascript
const alienShip = {
  invade: function () { 
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.')
  }
};
```

Then we can also do this thanks to ES6

```javascript
const alienShip = {
  invade () { 
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.')
  }
};
```

Make sure you include `,` at the end of each method to separate different methods. (like you do in properties)

In a nutshell, a method is a property that is a function.



Objects can be nested. An object can contain other objects inside of it. We use Bob: {...} to denote an object with name Bob and its fields inside the {}

```javascript
let masterObj = {
    outerObj: {
       property1: value,
       innerObj: {
           method1 () {
               console.log("yay")
           }
       }
    }
}
```



When we pass objects into functions, we pass the reference, ie. the function only knows the location of the object.

Therefore, we can mutate the field of the object passed in.

But we cannot reassign the variable passed in to another object! This is because the function only knows the location of memory, but not the pointer that points to the memory.

```javascript
let spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'red'
};
let tryReassignment = obj => {
  obj = {
    identified : false, 
    'transport type' : 'flying'
  }
  console.log(obj) // Prints {'identified': false, 'transport type': 'flying'}
};

tryReassignment(spaceship) // The attempt at reassignment does not work.
spaceship // Still returns {homePlanet : 'Earth', color : 'red'};

spaceship = {
  identified : false, 
  'transport type': 'flying'
}; // Regular reassignment still works.
```

So in the example above, obj is actually a fresh variable pointing at the new object, and the original spaceship variable still points at the old object.





We can iterate through the keys of an object using let .. in .. notation

```javascript
let spaceship = {
    crew: {
    captain: { 
        name: 'Lily', 
        degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
        cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') } 
        },
    'chief officer': { 
        name: 'Dan', 
        degree: 'Aerospace Engineering', 
        agree() { console.log('I agree, captain!') } 
        },
    medic: { 
        name: 'Clementine', 
        degree: 'Physics', 
        announce() { console.log(`Jets on!`) } },
    translator: {
        name: 'Shauna', 
        degree: 'Conservation Science', 
        powerFuel() { console.log('The tank is full!') } 
        }
    }
}; 
// for...in
for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
  console.log(`${crewMember}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}`)
};
```

Here, crewMember is assigned to the keys of spaceship.crew object (which is of type String!). So we need the long-winded `spaceship.crew[crewMember].name`. Notice we use the ${} notation as the input is a variable name that points to a string, not a String directly.





### Conclusion

Objects in JS is super clean because it's just key-value pairs!

This is true partly thanks to functions in JS being first-order object, which means they can be passed around like objects (see Higher-order functions). Though I don't think you can define your own properties and methods for them besides the built-in ones.	=> NOPE, turns out you can!

```javascript
function func() {
  console.log("yay")
}

func.prop = "a"

func()						//yay
console.log(func.prop)		//a
```

But then again, why would you.



A curious thing about functions, here is a function that returns a function (easy case from Haskell)

```javascript
function Accumulator(start) {
  var current = start;
  return function (x) {
    return current += x;
  };
}
```

It's behaviour is this:

```javascript
var a = Accumulator(4);
var x = a(5);   // x has value 9
x = a(2);       // x has value 11

var b = Accumulator(42);
x = b(7);       // x has value 49 (current = 49 in closure b)
x = a(7);       // x has value 18 (current = 18 in closure a)
```



Though we say "functional objects", we don't declare objects with functions. We're not at church numerals yet. Or are we?







## Advanced Objects

Methods that uses internal keys of an object needs to use the "this" keyword to access them. "this" refers to the *calling object*.

An exception is when using arrow functions to define methods in objects. Here, "this" is binded to the function itself. The moral is not to use arrow notation when defining methods!



JS doesn't have `private` built in. A convention to to have `_` before the key of a private field. But you can still set it if you want of course.

You can also use closures to mimic objects with functions, but that's for another day.



Getters:

```javascript
const robot = {
  _model: '1E78V2',
  _energyLevel: 100,
  get energyLevel() {
    if (typeof this._energyLevel == "number") {
      return `My current energy level is ${this._energyLevel}`
    } else {
      return "System malfunction: cannot retrieve energy level"
    }
  }
};

console.log(robot.energyLevel)
```

A getter is just a method really. Its main purpose is to make the code clearer.

When you evoke the getter method, you don't need to put `()` behind it, making it look like a property.

You cannot set the getter method name to the same name as a property. A general strategy is to put _ before the property name you are trying to get. If you set the getter method name to be the same as the key, it'll start an infinite self-calling chain once evoked:

```javascript
const obj = {
  key: null,
  get key() {
    return this.key
  }
}

obj.key 	//Call stack exceeded max limit
```





Setters:

```javascript
const person = {
  _age: 37,
  set age(newAge){
    if (typeof newAge === 'number'){
      this._age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log('You must assign a number to age');
    }
  }
};

person.age = 40;
console.log(person._age); // Logs: 40
person.age = '40'; // Logs: You must assign a number to age
```

Setters have pretty much the same syntax. You can evoke the setter method without () as if you are setting a real property, which you are not.

**Setter must have exactly one parameter**. This is different from ES5 where setters can have no argument as well. The argument is taken as the value on the RHS of the =, as seen above.



Factories:

A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned (this is like a class! Though you can't inherit factory methods ofc)

```javascript
const monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) => {
  return { 
    name: name,
    age: age, 
    energySource: energySource,
    scare() {
      console.log(catchPhrase);
    } 
  }
};

const ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');
ghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'
```

We can use property shorthand avoid saying `name: name, age: age` etc.

```javascript
const monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) => {
  return { 
    name,
    age, 
    energySource,
    scare() {
      console.log(catchPhrase);
    } 
  }
};
```

Notice property shorthand is not compatible for Internet Explorer, but so is most other things.



Destructured Assignment is another shorthand for getting values from the object and assigning it to your own variable.

The code:

```javascript
const age = person.age
```

is the same as the following code:

```javascript
const { age } = person
```





All Objects created inherit Object. methods from Object.prototype. Useful methods include Object.assign(target, *source)
