### Introduction



Why C# / Main language features:

- Object-oriented, component-oriented
- Type safety
- Garbage collection (automatic reclaiming of memory on unreachable objects)
- Nullable types (for static null check)
- Exception handling
- Lambda expressions
- Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
- Asynchronous operations



C# and .NET

- C# is compiled into an intermediate language that conforms to the Common Language Interface (CLI) specification
- The Microsoft implemented Common Language Runtime (CLR) then performs JIT compilation and executes code on machine.
- CLR has services like automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and resource management. Code compiled by CLR is called "managed code"



```c#
using System;

/* A Hello World program to introduce the C# language */
class Hello
{
    static void Main()
    {
		// This line prints "Hello, World"
        Console.Writeline("Hello, World");
    }
}
```









### Types

C# has an extensive type system that defines the structure and behaviour of the underlying data.



There are 2 kinds of types in C#:

- Value types: Variable stores underlying value. Multiple variables store different copies of their own value.
- Reference types: Variable stores reference to data in memory



- Value types
  - Simple types
    - [Signed integral](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types): `sbyte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
    - [Unsigned integral](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types): `byte`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`
    - [Unicode characters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-encoding-introduction): `char`, which represents a UTF-16 code unit
    - [IEEE binary floating-point](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types): `float`, `double`
    - [High-precision decimal floating-point](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types): `decimal`
    - Boolean: `bool`, which represents Boolean valuesâ€”values that are either `true` or `false`
  - Enum types
    - User-defined types of the form `enum E {...}`. An `enum` type is a distinct type with named constants. Every `enum` type has an underlying type, which must be one of the eight integral types. The set of values of an `enum` type is the same as the set of values of the underlying type.
  - Struct types => like classes but are value types (allocation on stack not heap) and no inheritance
    - User-defined types of the form `struct S {...}`
  - Nullable value types => Represented by `<type>?`, e.g,, `int?`, `string?`
    - Extensions of all other value types with a `null` value
    - The underlying type `System.Nullable<T>`
  - Tuple value types
    - User-defined types of the form `(T1, T2, ...)`
- Reference types
  - Class types => contains data members and methods
    - Ultimate base class of all other types: `object`
    - [Unicode strings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/character-encoding-introduction): `string`, which represents a sequence of UTF-16 code units
    - User-defined types of the form `class C {...}`
  - Interface types => implemented by `class` or `struct` types. A `class` or `struct` type may implement multiple interfaces
    - User-defined types of the form `interface I {...}`
  - Array types
    - Single-dimensional, multi-dimensional, and jagged. For example: `int[]`, `int[,]`, and `int[][]`
  - Delegate types => reference to methods so they are first class citizens (e.g., can be passed in as variables to functions)
    - User-defined types of the form `delegate int D(...)`



All types in C# inherit from `Object` based type. For a value type to become inherited from `Object`, we "box" them (the reverse is called "unbox"). Boxing simply means creating an instance of a reference type and putting the value into the box.

```C#
int i = 123;.
object o = i;    // Boxing
int j = (int)o;  // Unboxing
```





Tuples

```c#
// You can define a named tuple
(double Sum, int COunt) t2 = (4.5, 3);
Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {t2.count} elements is {ts.Sum}.");
```









### Program Structure

- Programs: 
- Namespaces: Types and members
- Types: Classes, structs, interfaces ...
- Members: Fields, methods, properties, events ...
- Assemblies: Compiled C# code, `.exe` for application implementation, `.dll` for library implementation



```C#
namespace Acme.Collections;

// Fully qualifieid name of this class is `Acme.Collections.Stack`
public class Stack<T>
{
    // 4 members, a field, 2 methods, and a nested class
    Entry _top;	// A field

    public void Push(T data)	// A method
    {
        _top = new Entry(_top, data);
    }

    public T Pop()	// A method
    {
        if (_top == null)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException();
        }
        T result = _top.Data;
        _top = _top.Next;

        return result;
    }

    class Entry	// A nested class
    {
        public Entry Next { get; set; }	// Property
        public T Data { get; set; }		// Property

        public Entry(Entry next, T data)	// Constructor
        {
            Next = next;
            Data = data;
        }
    }
}
```



And another program that makes use of that class

```C#
class Example
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var s = new Acme.Collections.Stack<int>();
        s.Push(1);
        s.Push(10);
        s.Push(100);
        Console.WriteLine(s.Pop());	// 100
        Console.WriteLine(s.Pop());	// 10
        Console.WriteLine(s.Pop());	// 1
    }
}
```



When you compile this program, the needed libraries are linked together, and are free to reference each other. Because of this, there is no need for forward referencing. Conceptually it's as if all code is added to the same large file.















### Variables and Types

```C#
int myNum = 5;
double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;
char myLetter = 'D';
bool myBool = true;
string myText = "Hello";
```



Multiple declaration

```c#
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
Console.WriteLine(x + y + z);

int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
Console.WriteLine(x + y + z);
```



Type casting

In C#, there are two types of casting:

- **Implicit Casting** (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
  `char` -> `int` -> `long` -> `float` -> `double`
- **Explicit Casting** (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
  `double` -> `float` -> `long` -> `int` -> `char`

```c#
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt;       // Automatic casting: int to double

double myDouble = 9.78;
int myInt = (int) myDouble;    // Manual casting: double to int
```







#### Strings

Concatenation

```c#
string firstName = "John ";
string lastName = "Doe";
string name = firstName + lastName;

string firstName = "John ";
string lastName = "Doe";
string name = string.Concat(firstName, lastName);
Console.WriteLine(name);
```



Interpolation

```c#
string firstName = "John";
string lastName = "Doe";
string name = $"My full name is: {firstName} {lastName}";
Console.WriteLine(name);
```









#### Arrays

```c#
string[] cars;
string[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

for (int i = 0; i < cars.Length; i++) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(cars[i]);
}

// Multi-dimensional
int[,] numbers = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8} };
numbers[0, 0] = 5;  // Change value to 5
Console.WriteLine(numbers[0, 0]); // Outputs 5 instead of 1
```









#### Enums

They are constant values with names that are compiled to the underlying integral values.

```c#
public enum SomeRootVegetable
{
    HorseRadish,
    Radish,
    Turnip
}

var turnip = SomeRootVegetable.Turnip;	// This is represented as an integer
```



You can define values that represent a specific set of values from the enum using bit flags

```c#
[Flags]
public enum Seasons
{
    None = 0,
    Summer = 1,
    Autumn = 2,
    Winter = 4,
    Spring = 8,
    All = Summmer | Autumn | Winter | Spring
}

var spring = Season.Spring;
var startingOnEquinox = Seasons.Spring | Seasons.Autumn;
var theYear = Seasons.All;
```

The underlying value is represented as a sequence of bits. Use values with no overlapping bits to avoid confusion.

This allows the use of logical operators for calculating union (`OR`) and intersection (`AND`) of set of enums.



If you explicitly cast `enum` type to an integral, it'll give you the underlying representation:

```c#
var theYear = (int)Seasons.All; 	// 15
```













### Conditionals and Branching

if ... else

```c#
int time = 22;
if (time < 10) 
{
  Console.WriteLine("Good morning.");
} 
else if (time < 20) 
{
  Console.WriteLine("Good day.");
} 
else 
{
  Console.WriteLine("Good evening.");
}
```



switch

```c#
int day = 4;
switch (day) 
{
  case 6:
    Console.WriteLine("Today is Saturday.");
    break;
  case 7:
    Console.WriteLine("Today is Sunday.");
    break;
  default:
    Console.WriteLine("Looking forward to the Weekend.");
    break;
}
```



while

```c#
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
```



for

```c#
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```



foreach

```c#
string[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
foreach (string i in cars) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```







### Methods

```c#
static void MyMethod() 
{
  Console.WriteLine("I just got executed!");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  MyMethod();
  MyMethod();
  MyMethod();
}

// Default parameters
static void MyMethod(string country = "Norway") 
{
  Console.WriteLine(country);
}
```



Overloading

```c#
static int PlusMethod(int x, int y)
{
  return x + y;
}

static double PlusMethod(double x, double y)
{
  return x + y;
}
```







### Classes and Objects

Class header:

- Attributes & modifiers of class
- Name of class
- Base class
- Interfaces implemented by the class

Classes can be instantiated with constructors. There are 2 kinds of constructors:

- A *parameterless constructor*, which initializes all fields to their default value.
- A *primary constructor*, which declares the required parameters for an instance of that type.

Instances of class (objects) are created by the `new` keyword

```C#
public class Point
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }
    
    public Point(int x, int y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);
}
```

Invokation of `new` allocates memory for a new instance, invokes a constructor to initialize the instance, and returns a reference to the instance.

When the reference is no longer reacheable, the memory is reclaimed. There is no facility for manual memory reclaiming in C#.



**Members**

Class members can static members (belong to class) or instance members (belong to object)

- **Constants**: Constant values associated with the class
- **Fields**: Variables that are associated with the class
- **Methods**: Actions that can be performed by the class
- **Properties**: Actions associated with reading and writing named properties of the class
- **Indexers**: Actions associated with indexing instances of the class like an array
- **Events**: Notifications that can be generated by the class
- **Operators**: Conversions and expression operators supported by the class
- **Constructors**: Actions required to initialize instances of the class or the class itself
- **Finalizers**: Actions done before instances of the class are permanently discarded
- **Types**: Nested types declared by the class



**Accessibility**

Defines region of program that can access the members

- `public`: Access isn't limited.
- `private`: Access is limited to this class.
- `protected`: Access is limited to this class or classes derived from this class.
- `internal`: Access is limited to the current assembly (`.exe` or `.dll`).
- `protected internal`: Access is limited to this class, classes derived from this class, or classes within the same assembly.
- `private protected`: Access is limited to this class or classes derived from this type within the same assembly.





**Generic class**

A generic class define type parameters. 

```c#
public class Pair<TFirst, TSecond>
{
    public TFirst First { get; }
    public TSecond Second { get; }
    
    public Pair(TFirst first, TSecond second) =>
        (First, Second) = (first, second);
}
```

When used, we must provide type arguments on instantiation.

```c#
var pair = new Pair<int, string>(1, "two");
int i = pair.First;
string s = pair.Second;
```





**Base class**

A class can inherit from a base class, identified by the name after `:`

```c#
public class Point3D : Point
{
    public int Z { get; set; }
     
    public Point3D(int x, int y, int z) : base(x, y)
    {
        Z = z;
    }
}
```

Derived class contains all members of its base class. It can add new members but cannot remove inherited members.

The superclass can be casted to its base class, where the type system simply restrict access to only inherited members

```C#
Point a = new Point(10, 20);
Point b = new Point3D(10, 20, 30);
```



**Interfaces**

Interface represents the contracts that implementations need to fulfil. Interfaces can inherit from interface(s)

```c#
interface IControl
{
    void Paint();
}

interface ITextBox : IControl
{
    void SetText(string text);
}

interface IListBox ; IControl
{
    void SetItems(string[] items);
}

interface IComboBox : ITextBox, IListBox { }

interface IDataBound
{
    void Bind(Binder b);
}
```

Classes can implement interface(s)

```c#
public class EditBox : IControl, IDataBound
{
    public void Paint() { }
    public void Bind(Binder b) { }
}
```

Similar to base classes, objects can be casted to an interface the class implement, which will again restrict the type system to only allow methods in that interface's contract

```c#
EditBox editBox = new EditBox();
IControl control = editBox;
IDataBound dataBound = editBox;
```





$$: What to do when there are clashes (e.g., with names) amonst the classes inherited?















```c#
class Car 
{
  string color = "red";

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car myObj = new Car();
    Console.WriteLine(myObj.color);
  }
}
```



Creating a class

```c#
// Create a Car class
class Car
{
  public string model;  // Create a field, with access modifier

  // Create a class constructor for the Car class
  public Car()
  {
    model = "Mustang"; // Set the initial value for model
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Car Ford = new Car();  // Create an object of the Car Class (this will call the constructor)
    Console.WriteLine(Ford.model);  // Print the value of model
  }
}
```



Inheritance

```c#
class Animal  // Base class (parent) 
{
  public void animalSound() 
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig : Animal  // Derived class (child) 
{
  public void animalSound() 
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog : Animal  // Derived class (child) 
{
  public void animalSound() 
  {
    Console.WriteLine("The dog says: bow wow");
  }
}
```



Via abstract class

```c#
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal
{
  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
  public abstract void animalSound();
  // Regular method
  public void sleep()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
  }
}

// Derived class (inherit from Animal)
class Pig : Animal
{
  public override void animalSound()
  {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Pig myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();  // Call the abstract method
    myPig.sleep();  // Call the regular method
  }
}
```



Via interface

```c#
// Interface
interface IAnimal 
{
  void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the IAnimal interface
class Pig : IAnimal 
{
  public void animalSound() 
  {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    Console.WriteLine("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Program 
{
  static void Main(string[] args) 
  {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
  }
}
```





### Exceptions

```c#
try
{
  int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
  Console.WriteLine(myNumbers[10]);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Something went wrong.");
}
finally
{
  Console.WriteLine("The 'try catch' is finished.");
}
```
