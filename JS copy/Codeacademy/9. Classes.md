# Classes

Classes were added in ES6 due to the popularity of OOP. In fact, Class is entirely an syntactical sugar to the existing prototype object programming.



Classes have constructor functions, which are executed every time an object is instantiated from the class

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}
```

Here `this` refers the object being instantiated. Also notice class names start with Capital letter by convention. In Classes, `,` is not needed to separate functions

To instantiate an object, we use the `new` keyword which calls the constructor function of the class.

```javascript
const myDog = new Dog("Koira")
```





### Inheritance

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
} 


class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name, usesLitter) {
    super(name);
    this._usesLitter = usesLitter;
  }
}

const bryceCat = new Cat('Bryce', false);
```

Inheritance in JS works like other languages. The subclass inherits all the properties and methods of its superclass.

Notice that in the constructor of the subclass, we evoke the constructor of the superclass using `super()` keyword.

It's almost always the case where you first evoke `super()` and then change its field using `this.` Otherwise, JS will throw a reference error.





### Static methods

Static methods are methods that you can call directly from the class, not the objects instantiated from that class. Use the `static` keyword before method.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  static generateName() {
    const names = ['Angel', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'Tara'];
    const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()*5);
    return names[randomNumber];
  }
} 
```

You can use it like this:

```javascript
console.log(Animal.generateName()); // returns a name
```

Remember Date.now() and Math.floor()? They are static methods.
