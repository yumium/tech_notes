# Promise

?:

- Promise is just, well, a promise to do something. It'll either resolve if successful, or be rejected if not
- The code inside the new Promise will run asynchronously upon instantiation?
- Promise solves the problem of 
  - Javascript callback hell, aka. Pyramid of Doom
  - Separation of concerns. The promise need not to worry for what to do if resolved or rejected, it simply reports back if it's resolved or rejected.
    The then() part will take care of the callbacks





```javascript
let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const a = 1 + 1
    if  (a === 2) {
        resolve('Success')
    } else {
        reject('Failure')
    }
})

p
.then(message => console.log(message))
.catch(message => console.log(message))
```

You can pass one value **of any type** into the resolve() and reject() functions. (You can ofc choose other names for those 2 functions, only the order matter). These are the values that will be passed into the callback of .then()

As JS doesn't care about white space, the syntax for .then and .catch is clearer this way. This is a code style convention.
